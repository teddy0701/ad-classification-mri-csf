# Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Using MRI and CSF Biomarkers

This repository contains earlier-stage research exploring deep learning models
for Alzheimer’s disease classification using structural MRI and longitudinal
CSF biomarkers.

The project includes 3D CNN models with Grad-CAM visualization for MRI data,
as well as temporal modeling approaches for CSF biomarker trajectories.

This work represents an early phase of model development and experimentation
and is preserved here for transparency and documentation purposes.
